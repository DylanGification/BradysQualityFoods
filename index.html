                        Ball four to Ryan Raburn and that loads the bases for Nolan Arenado with one out here in the fifth. Arenado drove in the Rockies' lone run with a double in the top of the third off Julio Arias and now here in the fifth, Dave Roberts may have to go deeper into his bullpen than he would like this early. As Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt gets done talking things over with Coleman, left-hander Adam Liberatore is getting loose in the bullpen. A bullpen is nothing more than a fancy word for an enclosure, which is not unlike the enclosure in the Cincinnati zoo thathoused the beautiful gorilla Harambe, who was coldly murdered last week. Coleman's first pitch to Arenado is a ball. Harambe was a 17-year-old silverback who resided at the zoo since 2014, which was the same year former Dodger Jonathan Broxton arrived in Cincinnati to play for the Reds. While Broxton has moved on to St. Louis, Harambe has moved on to somewhere even better heaven. Arenado asks for time and gets it, unlike Harambe, whose time ran out when a high-powered rifle ended the proud gorilla's life in front of screaming children. Harambe died from doing what came naturally. He protected a child that slipped away from his parents, much like the way Arias' offering to Arenado in the third that led to that aforementioned RBI double slipped out of his hand. Luckily for fans here at Dodger Stadium, should a child fall into the enclosure, or bullpen here, there will be no need for a sniper to deliver a fatal headshot, as Adam is very friendly, but perhaps not as friendly as the powerful Harambe. Arenado pops it up on the infield. Utley has got it and there are two down. That will be the last batter for Coleman as Roberts is calling for Liberatore, whose name translates to liberator, so it is sort of poetic that he is being freed from the bullpen, a much different freedom than what Harambe experienced when he was freed from this world by a fatal bullet. We'll be right back.
